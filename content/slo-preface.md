## Preface

Originally, I had intended this to be an essay, a blog post. I first conceived this work in 2019 when I was the CRE lead at Blameless. Delving deep into SLO implementations, I realized that creating good SLOs was not obvious or trivial. Indeed, just because you have SLOs, they can't predict the unpredictable—something so catastrophic that you just don't have indicators to know that it's coming.

Then came 2020 and the world was hit with a massive Grey Swan (it wasn't actually a Black Swan, but we'll get into why it wasn't in a bit). I had jotted down some notes at the time, but things were indeed chaotic, and I was just too busy to really formulate this into anything substantial.

Fast forward to 2025. The pandemic has come and subsided. What we're left with is a world that has changed quite a bit. One of the changes that has just started but is rapidly evolving is AI. Specifically, Generative AI and all of its surrounding tools. I've fully embraced these tools and the workflow changes they enable.

I took some of my scraps of notes and set off to write that blog post. As I embraced these new tools, they gave me a fantastic ability to amplify my ideas. As I was doing additional research, things began to fill out. It became an essay, then a small book, and now it's a codex on disruptive events in IT infrastructure and how you can mitigate them and navigate in and out of them with success.

One paradigm shift this document embraces is its dual audience. It's designed knowing full well that it will be placed as a reference document inside other AI tools, which will read it. The Python code in the chapters is mostly to convey some structured meaning to the AI, as all of the frontier models understand Python quite well. I think it will become the *latin* of the subsequent era. The humans wielding these tools will consult it more as an oracle and less as something you'd read from cover to cover. Not that you can't read it cover-to-cover, but this has been designed to be a living document. It will evolve over time, and I expect people to submit PRs to the GitHub site. The document will evolve and expand in the years to come.



Enjoy and Deploy!
