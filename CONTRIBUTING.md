## Contributing
I invite you to clone the repo, and submit PRs if you find an error. Use the GitHub Issues feature, and start or participate in a discussion. I'd like this to become a community resource for the SRE community. 
Yes, my opinions are reflected in the early stages of this book, but I am not so hubristic as to assume I "know all" or that my opinions are the only correct ones. I'd like this to be a resource so that we can make our systems not only resilient but anti-fragile. That will take a community to bring that about.

### How to Contribute
- Fork the repository
- Create a branch for your changes
- Make your edits to the content in the content/ directory
    - note if you are editing a section that didn't have images before,
    - you need to create a folder of the name you add to the manifest file and
    - add content to it (including the .md file)
- Update MANIFEST.md if you're adding new sections
- Submit a Pull Request with a clear description of your changes
- Small typo fixes are welcome
Thanks for helping improve the book.
We appreciate your time and feedback.
