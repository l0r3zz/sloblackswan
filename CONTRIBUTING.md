## Contributing
I invite you to clone the repo, and submit PRs if you find an error. Use the GitHub Issues feature, and start or participate in a discussion. I'd like this to become a community resource for the SRE community. 
Yes, my opinions are reflected in the early stages of this book, but I am not so hubristic as to assume I "know all" or that my opinions are the only correct ones. I'd like this to be a resource so that we can make our systems not only resilient but anti-fragile. That will take a community to bring that about.

### How to Contribute
